# Introduction

The goal of Primer Design is to create an accessible and approachable system that keeps user experience consistent across the breadth of GitHub products and services while also allowing flexibility for new ideas. These guidelines are created with *all* users in mind. These guidelines set a foundation for design principles, accessibility, layouts, content, and resources for multiple design tools.

## Designed with accessibility first
We created Primer Design so that GitHub can be used by everyone. We suggest guidelines that create the most opportunity for those with visual, hearing, cognitive, and mobile disabilities.

## Responsiveness
Primer Design works with all devices and includes guidelines for page layouts, hierarchy, navigation, and so much more.

## Tools that encourage collaboration
We use [Figma](http://figma.com) as our primary tool of choice because of its ability to create a more transparent work environment. Figma allows designers to share early and share often.
