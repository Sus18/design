# Design tools

Figma is a vital part of Primer Design's workflow. Figma's collaborative environment allows designers to work together across distance and give feedback asynchronously. Learn more about [GitHub's remote design culture here](https://www.figma.com/blog/github-case-study/).

## Resources
We provide some open source Figma files to help designers create more with GitHub.com and other GitHub products. Download them below.
